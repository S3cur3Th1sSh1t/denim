Denim
=======

Makes compiling nim code with obfuscator-llvm easy!
 - Windows only for now, but do you even need compiler obfuscation on other platforms?

### Setup 

1. Install nim
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/moloch--/denim/releases/latest) and run `denim setup`

### Compiling Code

`denim compile helloworld.nim`

### FAQ

#### Why'd you write this in Go?

I can write Go code a lot faster than nim, and I wanted to get this done quickly.
